# A simple introduction to JavaScript and the DOM ZADD

If you have GIT available, *clone* this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/03-lab-javascript-1.git` instead of just downloading it.

You must then create *your own repository on GitHub* for these files, then change the GIT remote to the GitHub URL for your new repository with the following commands:

- `git remote rm origin`
- `git remote add origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`

then check your remote is your own repository with:

- `git remote -v`

This exercise introduces a few fundamental Javascript principles:

- *immediately-executed function expressions* (stay out of the global namespace)
- *event listeners* (for capturing user actions)
- *DOM manipulation* (changing HTML elements and/or their properties)

Read through the comments in the code and try out the suggestions.
